Previously I have used HaxeFlixel only to prototype my games and learn Haxe, but now I decided to use it on my first commercial product. In this series of posts I will describe my experience and moving process from Starling (my main game development framework). Hopefully it will encourage more developers to use HaxeFlixel.
