I am an IT-specialist from Latvia. In the last few years I am working as a Multimedia developer in Fulda, Germany. There I am developing a learning software for the leading companies in the car manufacture and medicine industries.

Also I am interested in a Game Design and develop mobile games for iOS and Android markets using different technologies (AS3/Haxe/Swift).

I like to improve myself and gain new professional and personal skills. That's why in my free time I learn new languages (currently I learn Japanese) and attend a fitness club.
